A command line interface for accessing the wine review data.

syntax: {command, keyword} [key [conditional]value] ...

`key` is the search field to match with `value` when retrieving data according
to `keyword`. Multiple key-value pairs may be specified. A descriptive error is
notified to the user if there is an error with the input. Keywords and
suggested keys are listed below. A keyword without parameters will get all
results.

Values with multiple words should be encapsulated with either single or double
quotes.

Conditional operators specified before a value, such as >, <=, etc, searches a
string alphabetically or numerically compared to the value. There may be space
between the conditional and the value. Conditionals may be ignored if it is
part of a value by wrapping the value in quotes.

Results are limited to 10 by default, but may be changed by the `max` command.
To see more results from the last successful query, use the `page` command. The
command `page 1` will yield the same results as the initial command.

Use the `help` command for more commands and `help <command>` for more
information on the command.
