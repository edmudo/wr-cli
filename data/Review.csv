98224,"Aromas of this robust wine recall resin, raisin, vanilla and plum cake. The warm, thick palate offers prune, licorice and ground black pepper alongside robust tannins. There's not much fruit richness and the heat of alcohol throws this off balance.",87,@kerinokeefe,Jorche 2010 Riserva  (Primitivo di Manduria),Primitivo,Jorche
30918,"Fragrances of cherry cola and mocha yield to flavors of eucalyptus, mocha, black cherry and strawberry. This wine is bright on entry before being joined by strong tannins. Acidity ultimately wins out, leading to a smooth, lasting finish.",91,@worldwineguys,Urla 2011 Nexus Red (Aegean),Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Urla
128010,"A classic Washington tasting-room Riesling‚Äîonly better. Opulent and fruity, with apricots, star anise, mint, a very nice spicy streak that lifts it up, and adds a lot of complexity. Smooth and supple, it coats the palate, captures some floral highlights, even a bit of marshmallow.",92,@paulgwine¬†,Pacific Rim 2009 Riesling (Columbia Valley (WA)),Riesling,Pacific Rim
25748,"Borra demonstrates its mastery with whites in this interesting, perfect m√©lange of sweetness and zip. Made in a dry style, the sweetness is mostly in the aromatics, which imply peach-colored roses, and inviting mouthfeel, which imparts subtle grapefruit and stone fruit amidst all the crispness.",91,@vboone,Borra 2013 Artist Series-Limited Edition Nuvola Gew√ºrztraminer (Lodi),Gew√ºrztraminer,Borra
47756,"Dominated by Cabernet Franc, this is a pretty, pink, perfumed wine. It's light and fresh, crisply fragrant with wild strawberries. The acidity is balanced, integrated into the open, soft texture. The wine is ready to drink.",87,@vossroger,Bouvet-Ladubay NV Ros√© Excellence Brut Sparkling (Vin Mousseux),Sparkling Blend,Bouvet-Ladubay

176,"Haven't seen this unusual combination of grapes in quite some time, and you know what, it's much better now than when we last saw it in 2001. This vintage has a nice, almost magnetic nose, while the palate is firm and well structured, with cassis, black cherry, coffee and licorice flavors. It's a bit boring on the finish, but the mouthfeel and length are just fine. Fruity, rich and balanced. 325 cases made.",88,@wineschach,TerraMater 2006 Unusual Cabernet-Shiraz-Zinfandel Red (Maipo Valley),Red Blend,TerraMater
71782,"Feral strawberry grabs all the attention in this wildly fierce, high-acid wine that packs a punch in texture, tannin power and body. Small amounts of Syrah, Mourv√®dre and Petite Sirah figure into the blend, which is made in minuscule amounts.",90,@vboone,Crux 2014 Grenache (Russian River Valley),Grenache,Crux
6022,"Moderate in oak and well-structured, this estate-grown wine is subdued and classy, with defined layers of green olive, juicy apple and lemongrass, a tiny hint of jalape√±o adding a touch of spice. Food-friendly, it'll complement a versatile range of dishes.",90,@vboone,Truchard 2015 Chardonnay (Carneros),Chardonnay,Truchard
98543,"This wine starts with a refined nose of lemon, peach and flower notes. The palate is lively and balanced, and it offers ripe citrus flavors, buoyed by spice and flint notes. An expressive medium-bodied white with style.",88,@suskostrzewa,Gentilini 2010 Robola (Cephalonia),Robola,Gentilini
15448,"A classic of the genre, this combines a deep color with luscious fruit character and spicy accents on a velvety texture. Firm tannins lend an appetizing grip, while the fresh ripe blackberry, clove and cedar flavors seem to melt on the tongue and linger on the finish. It shows great complexity and balance in a traditional dry style.",93,@gordone_cellars,Rosenblum 2011 Carla's Vineyard Zinfandel (Contra Costa County),Zinfandel,Rosenblum
21857,"Coming from the more northerly parts of Burgundy, this is cool Chardonnay, with steel and minerality. It is firmly textured, its apple and quince flavors coming with a more citrus element.",86,@vossroger,Simonnet-Febvre 2010  Bourgogne,Chardonnay,Simonnet-Febvre
73138,"Aged in neutral French oak with partial malolactic fermentation, this vineyard-designated wine offers aromas of almond, mineral, green apple and spice.

24864,"Almost all varietal with just a dash of Cabernet Sauvignon (5%) to fill it out, this is an intriguing wine with notes of cherry cordial, chocolate and herbs.

65076,"There are pretty white-flower aromas that grace the bouquet of this wine, with a supporting core of pink apple, peach and ripe honeydew. Despite its light weight, there's a pleasant roundness to the midpalate, with lasting fruit impressions on the close.",86,@laurbuzz,Calmel & Joseph 2016 Villa Blanche Chardonnay (Pays d'Oc),Chardonnay,Calmel & Joseph
75000,"Lime, sea shell, rainy cement and orange-rind aromas make for a brisk entry to the nose of this bottling, rounded out by a touch of pineapple. The palate is framed by a chalky grip, and shows flavors of tangy lemon and slightly sour apple.",88,@mattkettmann,Alma Rosa 2015 Chardonnay (Santa Barbara County),Chardonnay,Alma Rosa
18953,"This is a firm and stony wine, with dry tannins that give structure to the intense acidity and the red cherry flavor. It's dense and concentrated, with a solid feel that demands several years of aging.",91,@vossroger,Richard Rottiers 2011  Moulin-√†-Vent,Gamay,Richard Rottiers
